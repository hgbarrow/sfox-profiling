## Usage
1. From the command line run `npm install`
2. In the sfox-profiling directory create a new file called "apikey.txt" that contains only your apikey. This can be done by running `echo <your_api_key_here> >> apikey.txt` in the command line.
3. run `npm run start` to kick of the profiling test. You must have at least 0.15 LTC or $6.75 on your SFOX account to perform this test.
